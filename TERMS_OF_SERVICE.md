# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** 05 August 2025

Welcome to the discord n8n trigger bot (“the Bot”). By using this Bot in your Discord server, you agree to the following terms:

🎯 **Purpose**
The Bot is designed to forward messages, reactions, and thread events from Discord channels to user-configured n8n webhooks, enabling workflow automation and integrations.

👤 **User Responsibilities**
- You must have the necessary permissions to add and configure the Bot in your Discord server.
- You are responsible for configuring webhooks and ensuring they are secure and under your control.
- You must not use the Bot for any illegal, abusive, or spam-related activities.
- You acknowledge that your Discord ID and username will be recorded for Terms of Service enforcement purposes.
- You understand that only server administrators who configure webhooks have their information tracked, not regular users communicating in the server.

📋 **Data Handling**
- The Bot only processes and forwards data necessary for its function (e.g., message content, author, channel, and event metadata).
- The Bot records Discord ID and username of administrators who configure webhooks solely for security and Terms of Service enforcement.
- Administrator tracking is limited to Discord ID and username only, ensuring data minimization.
- The Bot does not store or log message content or user data beyond what is required for channel-webhook mapping and administrator accountability.
- Users can request information about their tracked data by contacting the Bot maintainers.

🚫 **Prohibited Use**
- Do not use the Bot to collect data for advertising, analytics, or resale.
- Do not use the Bot to circumvent Discord's API restrictions or rate limits.
- Do not use the Bot to harass, spam, or abuse other users.

⚠️ **Service Limitations and Disclaimer**
- The Bot is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
- The Bot's maintainers are not responsible for any data loss, misuse, or damages resulting from its use.
- If your webhook receives 5 consecutive failed delivery attempts or returns a 404 error, the Bot will automatically pause sending messages to that webhook to prevent spam.
- You can re-enable webhook delivery by using the /remove command followed by /setup to reconfigure the channel with an updated webhook URL.

🔄 **Changes to Terms**
We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the Bot constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
