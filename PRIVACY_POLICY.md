# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 05 August 2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the discord n8n trigger bot (“the Bot”) handles your data.

📊 Data Collected
- The Bot processes message content, author information, channel and server metadata, and event types for the purpose of forwarding to n8n webhooks.
- The Bot stores only the minimum data required to map Discord channels to user-configured webhook URLs.
- The Bot records the Discord ID and username of server administrators who configure webhooks or add the Bot to servers for Terms of Service enforcement purposes.

🔄 Data Usage
- Data is only forwarded to the n8n webhook URLs you configure.
- The Bot does not log, store, or analyze message content or user data beyond what is necessary for its operation.
- Administrator information is used solely for contacting server owners regarding Terms of Service violations.
- The Bot does not share or sell your data to third parties.

🔒 Data Security
- Webhook URLs and administrator information are stored securely in the database and are only accessible to authorized personnel.
- We recommend using secure, secret webhook URLs and protecting your n8n instance.

🎛️ User Control and Data Retention
- Server administrators can remove or update webhook configurations at any time using the provided slash commands.
- To remove your stored administrator information, use the /remove command to delete webhook configurations from channels you manage.
- Administrator data is retained only as long as webhook configurations remain active in your server.
- If you wish to remove all your data, simply remove the Bot from your server.

✅ Compliance
