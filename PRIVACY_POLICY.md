Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the discord n8n trigger bot (“the Bot”) handles your data.

## 1. Data Collected
- The Bot processes message content, author information, channel and server metadata, and event types for the purpose of forwarding to n8n webhooks.
- The Bot stores only the minimum data required to map Discord channels to user-configured webhook URLs.

## 2. Data Usage
- Data is only forwarded to the n8n webhook URLs you configure.
- The Bot does not log, store, or analyze message content or user data beyond what is necessary for its operation.
- The Bot does not share or sell your data to third parties.

## 3. Data Security
- Webhook URLs are stored securely in the database and are only accessible to authorized server administrators.
- We recommend using secure, secret webhook URLs and protecting your n8n instance.

## 4. User Control
- Server administrators can remove or update webhook configurations at any time using the provided slash commands.
- If you wish to remove your data, simply remove the Bot from your server and/or delete webhook configurations.

## 5. Compliance

- The Bot does not collect or process data for advertising, analytics, or resale.
