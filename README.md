## 2. Set Up a Channel to Forward Messages

1. Go to the channel you want to forward messages from.

![Step 1: Add Bot to Server](https://n8n-discord-trigger-bot.emp0.com/image/step-1-add-bot-to-server.png)

2. Create a ```POST``` webhook on n8n to receive the requests

![Step 2: Setup Webhook](https://n8n-discord-trigger-bot.emp0.com/image/step-2-setup-webhook.png)

3. Type the following slash command:
   ```
   /setup <webhook_url>
   ```
   - Example:
     ```
     /setup https://your-n8n-server.com/webhook/discord-channel-A
     ```
The bot will test your webhook and confirm setup if successful.

## 3. How to Handle Webhook Data in n8n, Zapier, Make.com, or Custom Server

### **Supported Platforms**

### **n8n**
- Create a new **Webhook** node in n8n.
- Set the webhook URL to match what you used in `/setup`.
- The bot will POST a JSON payload to this URL for every event.
- You can now process the data in your n8n workflow (e.g., filter, store, send notifications, etc).

### **Zapier**
- Use the **Webhooks by Zapier** trigger.
- Set the trigger to "Catch Hook" and copy the custom webhook URL.
- Use this URL in `/setup`.
- Zapier will receive the JSON payload and you can build your automation.

### **Make.com**
- Use the **Webhooks** module to create a custom webhook.
- Copy the webhook URL and use it in `/setup`.
- Make.com will receive the JSON payload and you can build your scenario.

### **Custom Server**
- Set up an HTTP endpoint that accepts POST requests with JSON.
- Use the endpoint URL in `/setup`.
- Parse the JSON payload and process as needed.

```
{
  "event_type": "message_create",
  "timestamp": 1640995200000,
  "content": {

## 5. Advanced/Deployment/Developer Info

For self-hosting, deployment, and advanced configuration, see the `/deployment/` folder in this repository.

### **Data Backup System**

The bot uses a CSV-based backup system that automatically exports database data to CSV files and stores them in version control:

- **Automatic backups**: Every hour via scheduled task
- **CSV format**: Human-readable and easy to process
- **Version controlled**: All backups are committed to Git
- **Small size**: Efficient storage and transfer
- **Easy recovery**: Simple restore process

#### **GitHub Token Setup (Required for Backups)**

To enable automatic backups to GitHub, you need to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token:

1. **Create GitHub Token:**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a name like "n8n Discord Bot Backup"
   - Select the `repo` scope (full control of private repositories)
   - Copy the generated token

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username
   GITHUB_REPO=your_username/n8n_discord_bot
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```

3. **Test GitHub Authentication:**
   ```bash
   node test-github-auth.js
   ```

#### **Manual Backup Operations:**
```bash
# List all backups
node data-utils.js list

# Create a manual backup
node data-utils.js backup

# Restore from a specific backup
node data-utils.js restore backup-2025-01-11T03-00-00-964Z

# Show latest backup details
node data-utils.js latest
```

#### **Testing:**
```bash
# Test the backup system
node test-backup.js

# Test GitHub authentication
node test-github-auth.js
```

For more details, see the [data/README.md](./data/README.md) file.
